#### Here's More About Me:
I‚Äôm (almost) a polyglot programmer who solves problems through code. I hate stereotyping and respect other people‚Äôs opinion in a workspace. Although I know it's not  always possible or feasible, but I'd still prefer writing <b>clean</b> code any day. And <b>smart</b> code isn't always clean üí°. I‚Äôm also always on a lookout for tools that improve my code and my workflow.

I really admire people who understand the value of time and respect flexibility among their colleagues. Remote work is one such example.

While I‚Äôm not doing all that I think about traveling the world and riding a bike with my wife.
