#### Here's More About Me:
I’m (almost) a polyglot programmer who solves problems through code. I hate stereotyping and respect other people’s opinion in a workspace. <br />
Even though I know it's not possible or feasible sometimes, but I'd still prefer writing <b>clean</b> code any day. And <b>smart</b> code isn't always clean 💡. I’m also always on a lookout for tools that improve my code and my workflow.

I really admire people who understand the value of time and respect flexibility among their colleagues. Remote work is one such example.

When I’m not pushing commits, I think about traveling the world and riding a bike with my wife.
