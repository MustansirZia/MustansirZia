### Hi there! üëã

> ‚ÄùPremature optimization is the root of all evil, 97% of the time; Yet we should not pass opportunities in that critical 3%.‚Äù - David Knut


#### What I am and what I do:
I‚Äôm a polyglot programmer who solves problems through code. I can think logically in a variety of different languages and believe a good developer should never be restricted by platform or language. I hate stereotyping and respect other people‚Äôs opinion in a workspace. I like to write poetry and not prose. I‚Äôm always on a lookout for tools that improve my code and my workflow.

While I‚Äôm not doing all that I think about traveling the world and riding a bike with my wife.


#### What I like to work on:
I‚Äôm thrilled by bleeding edge. I get bored of using a decade old technology to solve a problem that has been solved decades ago. I‚Äôm also looking for people who understand the value of time and respect flexibility among their colleagues. Remote work is one such example.


#### What is my present job title:
Does it matter?
