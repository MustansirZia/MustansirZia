#### Here's More About Me:
I’m (almost) a polyglot programmer who solves problems through code. I hate stereotyping and respect other people’s opinion in a workspace. Although I know it's not always possible or feasible, but I'd still prefer writing <b>clean</b> code over <b>smart</b> code any day. I’m also always on a lookout for tools that improve my code and my workflow.

While I’m not doing all that I think about traveling the world and riding a bike with my wife.


#### Here's More About The People I like to Work With:
I really admire people who understand the value of time and respect flexibility among their colleagues. Remote work is one such example.
