> ‚ÄùPremature optimization is the root of all evil, 97% of the time; Yet we should not pass opportunities in that critical 3%.‚Äù - David Knut


#### Here's My Introduction:
I‚Äôm (almost) a polyglot programmer who solves problems through code. I hate stereotyping and respect other people‚Äôs opinion in a workspace. <br />
Even though I know it's not possible or feasible sometimes, but I'd still prefer writing <b>clean</b> code any day. And <b>smart</b> code isn't always clean üí°. I‚Äôm also always on a lookout for tools that improve my code and my workflow.

I really admire people who understand the value of time and respect flexibility among their colleagues. Remote work is one such example.

When I‚Äôm not pushing commits, I think about traveling the world and riding a bike with my wife.

#### Here's What I Do Professionally:
I'm part of geographically distributed team called [Hubilo](https://hubilo.com). We help bring people together in virtual events and try to recreate experiences that are akin to physical meetups. 

I spend most of my time authoring and maintaining Hubilo's distributed backend.
